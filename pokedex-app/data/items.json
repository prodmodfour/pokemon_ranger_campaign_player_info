They can take the form of a bracelet, a necklace, or an actual ring. GM TIP: Creating Your Own Items You’re going to want to create your own equipment; don’t be afraid to do so! One way to provide trainers with useful and flavorful equipment is to provide gear that gives small bonuses to Skills; ranging from +1 to +4 at the maximum. Some Gear may provide these bonuses only in specific circumstances; that kind of gear can afford to give higher bonuses, or simply be cheaper. Feel free to tailor these items to your PCs or NPCs, and to your setting. A “Pokémon League Cap” could be a great item to include to grant +2 to Command Checks in a Standard Pokémon setting; a Pokémon War Setting might be better off with a “Officer’s Stripes” or similar. When creating Items, assign them to an equipment slot that makes sense; that +2 Intimidate Eyepatch obviously goes on the Head Slot, but that +2 Intimidate Studded Leather Jacket could be a Body or Accessory Slot Item. Don’t be afraid to experiment with more exotic effects! For example, some equipment items may allow a Trainer to use a Move, such as a fancy hat that lets a Trainer use the Move Swagger once a Scene. These items should allow Trainers to use Moves at a lower rate than their natural frequency. Be careful that you don’t give out effects that are too powerful or that step on the toes of some PC classes! Finally, you can afford to be a little flexible with which items go in which equipment slots. While it’d make no sense to wear a Gas Mask and Sunglasses simultaneously, if someone wears a Helmet in their Head Slot, you may let them wear Sunglasses as an Accessory Slot Item.",
