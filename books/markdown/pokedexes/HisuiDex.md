IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: 
After Generation 8’s changes to the TM and TR classification, and with the release of Pokémon Legends: 
Arceus, it’s becoming clear that the direction that the Pokémon Franchise has been going in is not going 
to make converting Pokémon to PTU very easy.  The Gen 8 PokéDex, for instance, had to decide 
between accurately translating the TM and TR lists (which would mean they wouldn’t mesh up well with 
prior generations), or only putting the moves down in a way that they’d mesh with the existing 
Pokémon (which often makes those Pokémon far less usable).  
After consideration, I ended up releasing the Dex in a way that it meshes with existing content, but it still 
may not have been the right decision. I heavily encourage people to both A) use something like 
Bulbapedia or Serebii to get up-to-date movelists, and B) embrace fixing Pokémon that end up lackluster 
(in any ‘Dex, not just the new ones), to make them more fun to use. GameFreak’s choices can be odd 
sometimes, and they are not at all geared for supporting a tabletop environment. 
Therefore, while there may still be PokéDex updates pushed, any that do will end up being geared more 
toward giving you building blocks for Pokémon, which you can then improve for your own games. I know 
this isn’t an ideal scenario, but Pokémon has gotten to a point where it is literally impossible to unify all 
Pokémon in a way that matches the games. Even if the entire Dex was re-written and updated (a 
ridiculously huge task), there is no single game that holds data for all released Pokémon.  There’s simply 
no way for consistency. The franchise has pushed past the point where that’s sustainable. 
This Document has chosen to just fold all the Move Shop moves under Tutors. And honestly? I’d just fold 
all TMs and Tutors into one big Tutor list for all past Pokémon. It’s probably what should have been 
done for Gen 8, but things were close enough that I figured I might be able to match enough. The one 
exception to everything is that Dialga and Palkia have their standard PokéDex pages reprinted, with just 
the stats changed and a few different Abilities. 
There are no evolution items in this document, since they really don’t add anything except a tax on 
certain Pokémon – it’s far better to just freely let people have them, since they aren’t any more 
powerful. Nobody should have to jump through hoops to get access to new Pokémon, either – any that 
have an evolution split should just be able to choose, really, what Regional Form they want. 
All of this is mostly a long-winded way to say that that this likely won’t match anyone’s expectations, 
and that you’ll also need to do a fair bit of work yourself. Because, quite frankly, the movelists in Arceus 
suck. A lot. There will possibly be a release at some point of a booklet to help with that sort of process, 
but that depends on a lot of factors. I appreciate your understanding. 
Thanks for reading, 
DataNinja 
 
TLDR: Please don’t use these entries as sacrosanct. Especially the movelists. Please give these 
Pokémon some actual Moves if you want to use them! This game gave them tiny lists, with little to no 
Type coverage!
