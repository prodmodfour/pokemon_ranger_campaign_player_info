What Am I Looking At Here?
This is a supplementary playtest document for the fan-
made Pokémon Tabletop United roleplaying system, 
written for use with the 1.05 release version of PTU. 
We’ll occasionally release packets like this one to test 
experimental content and give us a sandbox to play with 
ideas that aren’t quite ready for a full release but which 
we want to get feedback and comments on. Everything 
you see here is subject to change! 
Stumbled on this PDF by chance and have no idea 
what we’re talking about? Check the following links 
and resources! These are also where you can give us 
feedback on what you see here and keep up with new 
playtest packet releases.

What’s New In This Packet?
There’s two important changes in this packet! 
First, on the next page, you will find the new effects for various stat conditions. For context, we are mainly trying 
to keep every status condition useful, but also want to move away from status conditions that simply lock down 
their targets and eat up their turns.
The second change is much more fun: I’m sure you noticed the shiny new Pokedex PDF File next to this one. 
That’s because this Playtest Packet has a ton of ability changes! Many Abilities were removed, many were added, 
and even more were altered. 
But first let’s take a moment to mourn those no longer with us. RIP 
Removed Abilities
- Aqua Boost, Ignition Boost, Thunder Boost, Fairy Aura, Dark Aura 	
---> (See “Type Aura”)
- Instinct, Daze, Gulp, Photosynthesis, Covert, Wave Rider	 	
	
---> Bye
- Berry Storage, Delivery Bird, Tingly Tongue, Run Up 	
	
	
---> Remade
- Fashion Designer, Gardener		
 	
	
	
	
	
---> Capabilities now
- Twisted Power	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
--->  Poke Edge
Also, you might be wondering: “Hey! The [Class] gives that Ability! If it got cut, what does it give now?”
For now, assume they still give the old Ability; so Dark Elementalist still gives Twisted Power, and Rider still gives 
Run Up.

Status Conditions
Paralysis: A paralyzed user’s Initiative is halved. Make a Save Check that succeeds on 11+ at start of the user’s 
turn. On a succesful check the user may act normally, but on a failed check the following effects occur:
- The user can only take a Standard OR Shift Action that round, but not both
- The user is Vulnerable for 1 full round
- The user cannot take attacks of opportunity for 1 full round
 
Flinch: Upon becoming Flinched, the user lowers their Initiative by 5 for the rest of the Scene and is Vulnerable 
for 1 full round. Multiple of instances of Flinch may stack; being switched out removes the Initiative-lowering 
effect. (Also yes, you can now Flinch people of a higher Initiative than yourself)
 
Infatuation: Infatuated users take a -5 penalty on all Damage Rolls that do not include their Crush as a target. 
For determining Damage Rolls that do include their Crush as a target, the Infatuated target’s Attack and Special 
Attack are halved. The user is cured of Infatuation with a Save Check of 16+ made at end of turn.
 
Confusion: Confused users cannot take Attacks of Opportunity. If a Confused user makes an Attack (even at­
tacks without rolls), roll 1d2. On 1, after the attack is resolved, the user loses Hit Points equal to half their Attack 
Stat if the Move was Physical, half or their Special Attack Stat if the Move was Special, or two Ticks of Hit Poitns 
if the Move was a Status Move. The user is cured of Confusion with a Save of 16+ made at end of turn.
 
Suppression: Suppressed users cannot use Moves with any Frequency other than “At-Will”. Suppression always 
lasts 1 full round.
 
Vulnerable: same but NOTE: Blinded, Sleeping, Fainted, Frozen, and Tripped targets are always considered Vul­
nerable.... so this is more a reminded to add Vulnerable to those conditions.
