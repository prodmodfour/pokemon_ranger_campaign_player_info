What Am I Looking At Here?
This is a supplementary playtest document for the fan-
made Pokémon Tabletop United roleplaying system, 
written for use with the 1.05 release version of PTU. 
We’ll occasionally release packets like this one to test 
experimental content and give us a sandbox to play with 
ideas that aren’t quite ready for a full release but which 
we want to get feedback and comments on. Everything 
you see here is subject to change! 
Stumbled on this PDF by chance and have no idea 
what we’re talking about? Check the following links 
and resources! These are also where you can give us 
feedback on what you see here and keep up with new 
playtest packet releases.

What’s New In This Packet?
While the last playtest packet back in May had a clear 
focus on mundane utility options and ways to build 
Trainers who don’t necessarily specialize in direct 
combat or Pokémon support, this packet doesn’t really 
have a singular focus. 
Instead, it’s a mish-mash of changes that are meant to 
smoothen out how the system plays or address concerns 
and issues that aren’t worth a whole big update and 
would otherwise fall by the wayside. You could say 
some of these are quality of life improvements, such as a 
revision to make Capture mechanics faster, or quick and 
dirty balance changes like dialing back the effectiveness 
of some defensive options in the system. 
We understand that some of these adjustments, despite 
addressing small subsets of the system, can actually 
result in pretty sweeping changes within a campaign! 
So keep in mind as you read this packet that all of this 
is playtest material, and it’s also sort of a sandbox for us 
devs to play around with ideas that aren’t quite ready for 
a full numbered release. 
Here you’ll find: 
Revisions to Cheerleader and some sources of Damage 
Reduction. With 1.05, we swung too far in the direction 
of buffing defensive play, and Damage Reduction as a 
whole became too powerful, especially when stacked.
A new draft of the Medic Class and related items and 
Features for wilderness survival. 
Revisions to Poké Edges, especially for Mixed Attackers. 
Revisions to the following core mechanics:
• 
Capture mechanics have been simplified and made 
to use d20s where rolling higher is better. This keeps 
it more in line with how the rest of the system works.
• 
Tutor Moves are now subject to restrictions by 
Pokémon level, which prevents Classes like Mentor 
and Chronicler from causing early game spikes in 
Pokémon Moveset power.
We hope you enjoy this playtest packet and look forward 
to your thoughts and comments!

Cheerleader
For some Trainers, the path to victory isn’t paved with complicated strategy or incredibly harsh training. 
Instead, they believe in their Pokémon and try to motivate them to battle to their best, even in the face of 
overwhelming odds. True to their name, Cheerleaders cheer on their Pokémon and drive them to greater 
heights of battle with their optimistic attitudes. 
Cheerleaders bring shine and happiness to traveling groups of Trainers, their words of motivation keeping 
their allies going even after devastating attacks. This doesn’t mean they’re all about blind optimism with 
no substance, however. Cheerleaders need leadership skills, and under their guidance, allies can find their 
second wind or push themselves to act quicker in battle.
Teamed up with cheery and motivating Pokémon, a Cheerleader can keep a traveling party in high spirits 
and fighting at their best all the time.

Medic
Wilderness Exploration, Competitive Battling, and Fighting Crime all run the risk of injury or worse. 
While Potions and other medical equipment are readily available, not much really compares to someone 
trained in how to treat injuries and medical emergencies.  While the introduction of Poké Centers has 
somewhat lessened demand, the world of Pokémon has always had a great need for medical professionals 
ready to assist those in need.
 
Groups of Trainers on the road rarely do not have a trained Medic among them, not only for the practicality 
but also for the great number of them.  Most begin their studies at local Poké Centers learning simple nursing; 
others come from Medical Schools; those from more out-of-the-way areas might just have knowledge on 
how to handle local herbal remedies.  Regardless of how experienced they are, their presence is usually a 
welcome one.

Supplementary Changes
The [Gift] tag denotes Features which grant other Edges 
or Features. Whenever a [Gift] Feature is taken and you 
already have one of the denoted Edges or Features, you

(depending on what you have) for which you qualify. 
And yes, we’ll be putting this on all the other stuff in the 
system that does this!

»»
Potions, Super Potions, Hyper Potions, Full Restores, 
Revives, Energy Powders, and Energy Roots used in

counts for the purposes of Field Clinic.)

Capture Mechanic Changes
A Capture Roll is now a 1d20 roll where you aim to meet or exceed a target number. If you have gained the 
Amateur Trainer bonus at Level 5, add +1 to this roll. If you have gained the Capable Trainer bonus at Level 10, 
instead add +2 to this roll. If Veteran Trainer, +3; if Elite Trainer, +4, if Champion, +5. 
A Pokémon’s Capture Rate depends on its Level, Hit Points, Status Afflictions, Evolutionary Stage, and Rarity.  
 
A Pokémon’s base Capture Rate is 10. For each 10 Levels it has, add 1 to this Capture Rate. 
In the event you want the Pokémon to be more difficult to catch, like if it were a Boss, Shiny, or a Legendary 
Pokémon, then raise this number by a value between 5 and 20 based on what you feel is appropriate for its rarity. 
Remember that Pokémon that have been Knocked Out cannot be captured; Poké Balls will simply fail to attempt 
to energize them.
 
Next, go down the following checklist. For each condition that applies check every check box next to the condition. 
Then, at the end, add up the total number of check boxes and subtract 2 from the Pokémon’s Capture for each 
check box.
☐ Is the Pokémon at or under 50% its maximum Hit Points?  
☐ Is the Pokémon at or under 25% its maximum Hit Points?  
☐☐ Is the Pokémon suffering from 5 or more Injuries? 
☐ Is the Pokémon suffering from at least one Persistent or Volatile Status Affliction? 
☐☐ Does the Pokémon have exactly two evolution stages remaining?  
☐ Does the Pokémon have exactly one evolution stage remaining? 
For example, a level 10 Pikachu at 70% Hit Points and Confused would have a Capture Rate of 7.
Math: Base (10+1) -2 (Status Affliction) -2 (one evolutionary stage) = 7
A Shiny level 30 Caterpie that is at 40% Hit Points would have a Capture Rate of 12.
Math: Base (10+3) +5 (GM discretion Shiny bonus) -2 (Hit Points) -4 (two evolutionary stages) = 12
A level 80 Hydreigon that is at exactly 1 Hit Point and is Burned, Poisoned, and has 5 Injuries would have a 
Capture Rate of 
Math: Base (10+8) - 4 (Hit Points) -2 (Status Affliction) -4 (Injuries) = 10 
Supplementary Changes
Poké Balls are pretty easy to convert. Flip the sign on 
all modifiers, then divide by 5. For example, a Great 
Ball gives a +2 bonus to Capturing. An Ultra Ball gives 
+3. A Timer Ball starts at -1 and can go up to +4. As a 
general rule, you can apply this to most other effects in 
the system that affect Captures. For example, Capture 
Specialist’s Snare gives a +2 bonus. 
In addition, replace Gotta Catch ‘Em All with the 
following revision: 
Gotta Catch ‘Em All
Prerequisites: Advanced Capture Techniques Rank 3
Static
Effect: Every time you Capture a Wild Pokémon that 
is a member of an evolutionary family of which you 
own no other Pokémon, you gain 1 Collector Stack. 
Whenever you make a Capture Roll, you may spend up 
to three Collector Stacks to gain an equal bonus to your 
Capture Roll, or you may spend three Collector Stacks 
to re-roll entirely.

Poké Edge Changes
Basic Ranged Attacks now has no Level Prerequisite. 
Mixed Sweeper is replaced with the following: 
Mixed Power
Prerequisites: Level 10, Invested at least 5 Level-Up Stat 
Points into both Attack and Special Attack
Cost: 2 Tutor Points
Effect: The user gains the Twisted Power Ability.
Fire Ace’s Incadescence is adjusted as follows: 
Incandescence
[Orders] [Stratagem]
Prerequisites: Brightest Flame, Type-Linked Skill at 
Expert
Bind 2 AP – Standard Action
Trigger: Your Fire-Type Pokémon
Effect: While this Feature is Bound, the target gains 
the Mixed Power Poké Edge effect when using damag-
ing Fire-Type Attacks. If the target already has Mixed 
Power, they instead add their entire Attack and Special 
Attack Stats to all damaging Fire-Type Attacks, instead 
of one or the other. This does not stack with Twisted 
Power.
The following Pokémon which naturally gain Twisted 
Power instead gain the Abilities below in that slot:
Tynamo Line: Sequence
Cacnea Line: Needles (Rough Skin becomes a Basic 
Ability, Needles is an Advanced Ability in its place)
Exeggcute Line: Eggscellence
Carvanha: Pack Hunt
Sharpedo: Bully
Murkrow: Magician
Hydreigon: Bully 
New and Adjusted Abilities: 
Ability: Needles
Static
Effect: Connection – Needle Arm. Whenever the user 
hits a target with a Physical Melee attack, that target 
loses a Tick of Hit Points.
Ability: Sequence
At-Will – Free Action
Trigger: The user uses an Electric Attack
Effect: For every allied Electric-Type Pokémon adjacent 
to the user, the triggering Attack deals an additional +3 
Damage. 
Ability: Eggscellence
Static
Effect: Connection – Barrage. The user receives STAB 
when using Barrage and Egg Bomb. These Moves deal 
Damage as if one step more effective on 16+.
Tutor and Inheritance Move Changes
All Moves taught through Tutoring Features (Ex: Mentor’s Move Tutor and Egg Tutor, Chronicler’s Archive Tutor) 
now have prerequisites: 
»»
Pokémon under Level 20 may only learn Moves of an At-Will or EOT Frequency with a max Damage Base of 7.
»»
Pokémon from Level 20 to 29 may only learn Moves with up to a Scene Frequency and max Damage Base of 9.
»»
Pokémonn at Level 30 and above have no restrictions when being taught Moves through Tutors.
This applies to Inheritance Moves as well. If a Pokémon were to have Heal Pulse as its only Inheritance Move, that 
Move would be gained at Level 30 despite the Level 20 slot for Inheritance Moves being empty.
