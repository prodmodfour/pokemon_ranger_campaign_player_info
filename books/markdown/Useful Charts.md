Combat Maneuvers
Maneuver: Attack of Opportunity
Action: Free
Trigger: See Below
Effect: You may make a Struggle Attack against the 
triggering foe as an Interrupt.  You may use Attack 
of Opportunity only once per round. Attacks of 
Opportunity cannot be made by Sleeping, Flinched, or 
Paralyzed targets.
Attacks of Opportunity can be triggered in multiple 
ways:
»»
An adjacent foe uses a Push, Grapple, Disarm, Trip, 
or Dirty Trick Maneuver that does not target you.
»»
An adjacent foe stands up. 
»»
An adjacent foe uses a Ranged Attack that does not 
target someone adjacent to it.
»»
An adjacent foe uses a Standard Action to pick up or 
retrieve an item.
»»
An adjacent foe Shifts out of a Square adjacent to 
you.  
Maneuver: Disengage
Action: Shift
Effect: You may Shift 1 Meter. Shifting this way does not 
provoke an Attack of Opportunity.
Maneuver: Disarm
Action: Standard
AC: 6
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat or 
Stealth Checks. If you win, the target’s Held Item (Main 
Hand or Off-Hand for humans) falls to the ground.
Maneuver: Dirty Trick
Action: Standard
AC: 2
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You may perform any of the Dirty Tricks listed 
below. You may use each trick only once each Scene per 
target.
Hinder
You and the target make Opposed 
Athletics Checks. If you win, the target is 
Slowed and takes a -2 penalty to all Skill 
Checks  for one full round. 
Blind
You and the target make Opposed Stealth 
Checks. If you win, the target is Blinded 
for one full round.
Low Blow
You and the target make Opposed Ac-
robatics Checks. If you win, the target is 
Vulnerable and has their Initiative set to 
0 until the end of your next turn.
Maneuver: Manipulate
Action: Standard
AC: 2
Class: Status
Range: 6, 1 Target
Effect: You may perform any of the Manipulations listed 
below. You may use each Manipulation only once each 
Scene per target. Manipulate can only be performed by 
Trainers.
Bon Mot
Make a Guile Check, opposed by the 
target’s Guile or Focus. If you win, the 
target is Enraged and cannot spend AP for 
one full round. The target does not gain a 
Save Check against this effect. 
Flirt
Make a Charm Check, opposed by the 
target’s Charm or Focus. If you win, the 
target is Infatuated with you for one full 
round. The target automatically fails their 
Save Check.
Terrorize Make an Intimidate Check, opposed by the 
target’s Intimidate or Focus. If you win, the 
target loses all Temporary Hit Points and 
can only use At-Will Frequency Moves for 
one full round.


## Page 4

Maneuver: Push
Action: Standard
AC: 4
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat 
or Athletics Checks. If you win, the target is Pushed 
back 1 Meter directly away from you. If you have Move-
ment remaining this round, you may then Move into 
the newly occupied Space, and Push the target again. 
This continues until you choose to stop, or have no 
Movement remaining for the round. Push may only be 
used against a target whose weight is no heavier than 
your Heavy Lifting rating.
 
Maneuver: Sprint
Action: Standard
Class: Status
Range: Self
Effect: Increase your Movement Speeds by 50% for the 
rest of your turn.
 
Maneuver: Trip
Action: Standard
AC: 6
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Combat 
or Acrobatics Checks. If you win, the target is knocked 
over and Tripped.
 
Maneuver: Intercept Melee
Action: Full Action, Interrupt
Class: Status
Trigger: An ally within Movement range is hit by an 
adjacent foe.
Effect: You must make an Acrobatics or Athletics 
Check, with a DC equal to three times the number of 
meters they have to move to reach the triggering Ally; If 
you succeed, you Push the triggering Ally 1 Meter away 
from you, and Shift to occupy their space, and are hit by 
the triggering attack. On Failure to make the Check, the 
user still Shifts a number of meters equal a third of their 
check result.
Note: If the target that was Intercepted was hit by an 
Area of Effect Move, and the 1 meter push does not 
remove them from the Area of Effect, the Intercept has 
no effect since they are still in the area of the attack – 
it would cause the Interceptor to be hit by the Move 
however.
Maneuver: Intercept Ranged
Action: Full Action, Interrupt
Class: Status
Trigger: A Ranged X-Target attack passes within your 
Movement Range.
Effect: Select a Square within your Movement Range 
that lies directly between the source of the attack and 
the target of the attack. Make an Acrobatics or Athletics 
Check; you may Shift a number of Meters equal to half 
the result towards the chosen square. If you succeed, 
you take the attack instead of its intended target. If you 
fail, you still Shift a number of Meters equal to half the 
result.
Special: Pokemon must have a Loyalty of 3 or greater to 
make Intercept Melee and Intercept Range Maneuvers, 
and may only Intercept attacks against their Trainer. At 
Loyalty 6, Pokemon may Intercept for any Ally.
Additional Rules
»»
Pokémon and Trainers may only Intercept against 
Priority and Interrupt Moves if they are faster than 
the user of those Moves.
»»
Moves that cannot miss (such as Aura Sphere or 
Swift) cannot be Intercepted.
»»
Pokémon and Trainers cannot attempt Intercepts if 
they are Asleep, Confused, Enraged, Frozen, Stuck, 
Paralyzed, or otherwise unable to move.
»»
Intercepts may not be used to move the Intercepting 
Pokémon or Trainer OUT of the way of an attack. 
They will always be hit, regardless.


## Page 5

Maneuver: Grapple
Action: Standard
AC: 4
Class: Status
Range: Melee, 1 Target
Effect: You and the target each make opposed Com-
bat or Athletics Checks. If you win, you and the target 
each become Grappled, and you gain Dominance in the 
Grapple.
Pokémon and Trainers that are Grappled
»»
Are Vulnerable
»»
Cannot take Shift Actions, or any actions that would 
cause them to Shift.
»»
Gain a -6 penalty to Accuracy Rolls if targeting any-
one outside of the Grapple.
»»
Additionally, Grapple has other effects on whether 
the target has or doesn’t have Dominance.
If a target begins their turn as a part of a Grapple but 
with no Dominance, they may choose to contest the 
Grapple as a Full Action. If they do, all participants 
make opposed Combat or Athletics Check. Whoever 
wins then may choose to either continue the Grapple 
and gain Dominance, or to end the Grapple.
If a target has the Phasing or Teleporter Capability, they 
may also use those to escape from a Grapple on their 
turn with no check required. 
If a target begins their turn as part of a Grapple and has 
Dominance, they may take one of the following actions 
as a Full Action.
»»
End the Grapple.
»»
Secure: They gain a +3 Bonus to the next opposed 
check they make in the Grapple.
»»
Attack: They may automatically hit with an Un-
armed Struggle Attack.
»»
Move: They Shift, dragging the other person in the 
grapple with them. The user’s Movement Capability 
is lowered by the other grappler’s Weight Class.

Calculating Capture Rates
A Pokémon’s Capture Rate depends on its Level, Hit Points, Status Afflictions, Evolutionary Stage, and Rarity. 
First, begin with 100.  Then subtract the Pokémon’s Level x2.  
Next, look at the Pokémon’s current Hit Points. If the Pokémon is above 75% Hit Points, subtract 30 from the 
Pokémon’s Capture Rate. If the Pokémon is at 75% Hit Points or lower, subtract 15 from the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate.  If the Pokémon is at 50% or lower, the Capture Rate is unmodified. If the Pokémon is at 25% Hit Points or 
lower, add a total of +15 to the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.  And if the Pokémon is at exactly 1 Hit Point, add a total 
of +30 to the Pokémon’s Capture Rate. Pokémon reduced to 0 Hit Points or less cannot be captured. Poké Balls will 
simply fail to attempt to energize them. 
Next, look at the Pokémon’s Evolutionary Stage.  If the Pokémon has two evolutions remaining, add +10 to the 
Pokémon’s Capture Rate.  If the Pokémon has one evolution remaining, don’t change the Capture Rate. If the 
Pokémon has no evolutions remaining, subtract 10 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.
Next, consider the Pokémon’s Rarity. Shiny Pokémon subtract 10 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate. Legendary 
Pokémon subtract 30 from the Pokémon’s Capture Rate.
And last, consider any Status Afflictions and Injuries. Persistent Conditions add +10 to the Pokémon’s Capture 
Rate; Injuries and Volatile Conditions add +5. Additionally, Stuck adds +10 to Capture Rate, and Slow adds +5.
